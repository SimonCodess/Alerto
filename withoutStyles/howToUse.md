# Alerto (Without Predefined CSS)

### How to Use
-   Include the JavaScript Code
Add the Alerto JavaScript code to your project.

-  Style Your Alerts
Since this version doesn't include predefined CSS, you'll need to define your own styles for the alerts. Use the following classes:

- `.alert-container`: Container for the alert.
- `.alert`: Base class for alerts.
- `.alert-primary`, `.alert-success`, `.alert-danger`, `.alert-warning`, `.alert-info`: State-specific styles.
